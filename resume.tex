%   {\bf Travel The World}\\
%   I was born near Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and moved to the United States shortly afterwards. All my life I have been traveling. In recent years I have explored the United States from California to New York, and been on three trips to Europe. With only four more continents to explore I plan to visit all before I settle down in one place -- but only if I have to settle.\\
%   \\
%   {\bf Become Tri-Lingual}\\
%   Whether it means drawing up an idea, programming, or verbal, communication interests me. Because of this, and to facilitate my travel, I've long had a goal of learning at least two other languages. I've taken four years of French and have used it to get around France and book an apartment in Montmartre, Paris among other things. I'm currently learning the Japanese syllalibraries and planing on taking a class next semester.\\
%   \\
%   {\bf Start my own business}\\
%   To facilitate longterm travel, I would need to make money while on the move. I hope to do this by working on web design and Ruby on Rails based sites over the internet. Afterall, why tie myself down to an office when all I need is a computer to do my job?\\
