          %\\
          %Contracted to take an image of a email announcment for Liskow \& Lewis, a law firm located in Houston. I re-implemented the image in HTML and CSS. Though email uses regular HTML and CSS for content and layout respecivly, email clients do not adhere to the standards of those languages. Due to the irregularities between email clients, this became one of my more challenging projects. This email went out to about 2500 people, including the entire law firm, their families and clients.

          %Avril Six is part of a birthday present for my friend whose birthday is on april six. I sent her a large hard drive full of music, and I needed a neat way to show her the highlights -- so I made another Rails based website, using Heroku as a Rails server and Amazon S3 for storage. This was my first time using any sort of cloud hosting, and using Ruby's Gems made the intergration very simple.  \\

To get the internship I re-emplemented his website using up to date standards (HTML5/CSS3) and added database functionality using Rails. Maintaining his website is now much easier using a database to hold his portfolio. I also re-wrote the CSS using the Blueprint CSS framework to ease later modification.\\

%          {\bf Travel The World}\\
%          I was born near Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and moved to the United States shortly afterwards. All my life I have been traveling. In recent years I have explored the United States from California to New York, and been on three trips to Europe. With only four more continents to explore I plan to visit all before I settle down in one place -- but only if I have to settle.\\
%          \\
%          {\bf Become Tri-Lingual}\\
%          Whether it means drawing up an idea, programming, or verbal, communication interests me. Because of this, and to facilitate my travel, I've long had a goal of learning at least two other languages. I've taken four years of French and have used it to get around France and book an apartment in Montmartre, Paris among other things. I'm currently learning the Japanese syllalibraries and planing on taking a class next semester.\\
%          \\
%          {\bf Start my own business}\\
%          To facilitate longterm travel, I would need to make money while on the move. I hope to do this by working on web design and Ruby on Rails based sites over the internet. Afterall, why tie myself down to an office when all I need is a computer to do my job?\\
